-- Module      : Network.MQTT.Connection
-- Copyright   : (c) Plow Technologies, 2023
-- Maintainer  : alberto.valverde@plowtech.net
--
-- This module provides a simpler and more convenient API over net-mqtt:
--
-- * It allows multiple listener callbacks to be added at any point of the lifetime of
-- 'Connection', not just one at creation time. These listeners will be
-- un-subscribed automatically when they're garbage-collected which allows for
-- simpler book-keeping by client code.
--
-- * Multiple listeners can subscribe to the same or overlapping topics and
-- messages will be routed to all of them as expected. This allows greater
-- composability in which components can setup their own subscriptions if they
-- can get a handle of the 'Connection' in 'IO' .
--
-- * The connection will automatically reconnect when it goes down.
